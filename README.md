# Description

This is a 7X prototyping project. It is a basic todo list web app. This app will have the following features.

1. An Axum web server
2. A React front-end
3. ~~A deployment pipeline to Amazon EC2~~ didn't get this far

# Post-mortem

Well, that was a fun 10 hours. Things went fairly smoothly until I got deeper into Axum. I've still got lots to learn with Rust in general, but I'm really liking Axum now that I'm getting the hang of it. I think with some more practice and learning I'll be able to make some pretty fast APIs with it.

Goal for next week is to do the same project over from scratch, but this time hopefully I'll finish the core app with enough time to try pushing to an EC2 instance. That should be fun.
