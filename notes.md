-   running into axum issue. since axum is not a crate on crates.io yet, I have to use a locally cloned version of the repo. getting this import to work is tricky for some reason.
    -   answer is to set the path to "../../axum/axum". the actual axum lib is nested in the repo. perhaps a symlink would be a better option in the future
-   CORS presents an issue. solution is to add a CorsLayer to axum using the tower-http library. be sure to use allow methods, origin, and headers
-   git is being wonky due to windows and WSL. setting up an SSH key for WSL to use when pushing to github
    -   setting up ssh for git is an ideal option. need to do this for all machines in the future. way simple and less of a hassle
-   I think going forward I'll move all installed dev tools into WSL. its just way easier to deal with. I could probably move cargo and rust into WSL as well. The less I have to touch windows the better.
-   Next Steps:
    -   create postgres database
    -   connect server to database
    -   create route for registering
-   TIME REMAINING: 5.5 hours
-   adding the database and tables went well
-   adding the register user component went well
-   adding route for registration is challenging. need to learn the tokio-postgres type translations better
-   okay, finally got the db insert working for registration. still pretty hacky, just manually matching on the results to see if there are bugs, which isn't very ergonomic. need to figure out how to pass the errors from the connection back to the response. but it works for now.
-   note for postgres: when using the uuid type as a primary key, make sure to set the default to gen_random_uuid(). it doesn't generate these automatically if set as primary key
